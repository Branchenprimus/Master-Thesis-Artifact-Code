*   **Validating Ontology Metadata**: Use the `:Ontology` shape to validate the metadata of an ontology, such as its title, description, and version information.
*   **Validating Class Definitions**: Use the `:Class` shape to validate the definitions of classes in an ontology, such as their labels, comments, and subclass relationships.
*   **Validating Property Definitions**: Use the `:Property` shape to validate the definitions of properties in an ontology, such as their labels, comments, and domain and range restrictions.
*   **Validating Instance Data**: Use the `:Agent`, `:Person`, and `:Organization` shapes to validate instance data, such as the metadata of agents, people, and organizations.

### Example Validation Queries

The following are example validation queries that can be used to validate data against the SHACL shapes defined above:

*   **Validate Ontology Metadata**:
